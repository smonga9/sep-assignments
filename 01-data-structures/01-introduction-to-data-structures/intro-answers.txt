Question #1 - How does your data structure allow developers to access and manipulate the data?

Line:
1. When appending a new member to the array, each element is iterated through to find a match for a particular member of the array. When removing a member and setting it to empty or nil causes the line to be shorter.

Pixel
1. When using x and y and removing a pixel refers to the position directly within the array. Removing a pixel is more of a reset of the position with nil.


Question #2 - If a developer wanted to find a specific element in your data structure, how would you search for it?

Line:
1. When searching for an element, one must iterate over each element until there is a match.

Pixel:
1. Searching for a pixel using the x and y by accessing the element indices within the 2D array.

Question #3 - What other real-world data can each structure represent?

Line & Pixel:
